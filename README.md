# Time-Mechanics

## What is it about?
This is a Unity project example, wherein there are scripts which allows the user to change the behaviour of time in the game, which are: <br>
<ul><li> Slowing down time (Bullet-time physics) </li>
<li>Speeding up time</li>
<li>Reversing time </li>
</ul>

## Demo scenes:
So, in the demo scenes, you control a FirstPersonCharacter, and on clicking at any point in the world, it generates an explosion, just to make the objects behave according to the physics, and on pressing the right-click, triggers the corresponding script. <br>

The scripts have parameters like slowing down factor, and duration, which can be changed as per the user's liking. In the time reverse scene, the time reversal mechanic can be applied onto one object as per now, but in updates, you can have all the objects as a child of a gameobject, and it will be applied to each of the children.
