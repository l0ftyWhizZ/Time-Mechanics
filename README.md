# Time-Mechanics

## What is it about?
This is a Unity project example, wherein there are scripts which allows the user to change the behaviour of time in the game, which are: <br>
<ul><li> Slowing down time (Bullet-time physics) </li>
<li>Speeding up time</li>
<li>Reversing time </li>
</ul>

## Demo scene:
So, in the demo scenes, you control a FirstPersonCharacter, and on clicking on any point in the world, it generates an explosion which triggers the time mechanism. <br>

The scripts have parameters like slowing down factor, and duration, which can be changed as per the user's liking.
